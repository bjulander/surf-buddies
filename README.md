# Surf Buddies

 Surf Buddies is a social media platform built exclusively for surfers. Being stuck in a place and not being able to surf is the definition of hell. Surf Buddies gives surfers more ways to get out on the water. At home with no car or no one to go surfing with is a sad truth most people face. Surf Buddies lets people connect with others in the area that either want to surf, but dont know where to go, dont have a way to transport their gear or themselves to the water, or are fully capable of going but dont like to surf alone for safety or other reasons. Not only does Surf Buddies give clear and accurate desciptions of beaches and breaks in an area, it also lets users review the spots and input suggested experience levels to ensure every surf knows what to expect before arrival. This allows for people to plan accordingly for whatever the occasion may be: family trip, teaching a friend, local hotspot, etc. This app also lets users post and sell any equipment to fellow surfers! So whether your buying or selling equipment, you can be sure the next tool in your belt is what you fully expect before you buy.
